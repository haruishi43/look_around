# TODOs

## Toy Problem

- [ ] port over `pers2pano` codes (`data` is quite useful)
- [ ] port over `mycv` codes (probably make it a dependency)
  - [ ] configuration style
  - [ ] modeling and training hooks
- [ ] port over `rl` codes (`ppo` and `a3c`)
  - [ ] projects like the ones I did before
  - [ ] future work will be `soft-actor`
- [ ] simple environment codes (state, action, rewards, terminal conditions)
- [ ] make a dataset
- [ ] run toy problem
